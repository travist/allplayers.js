This is the AllPlayers.com javascript API library.

Building
====================
To build this library you must first install ```node.js```.  Once you have node.js installed, you can clone this repo in a directory and then type...

```
npm install

This will install all the Grunt.js dependencies.  After these have been downloaded, you can then compile the JavaScript using.

```
grunt
```
